# Search---Yelp-Dataset-Challenge
We plan to create a model to recommend restaurant businesses to users using Item-Based Collaborative Filtering. We are using stratified sampling and k-fold cross-validation to obtain train and test sets as well as train parameters. We also plan to develop a Language Model with Dirichlet Smoothing using Lucene Indexing and NLTK based on user's reviews to search restaurants that match the user's interest. We also aim to generate a short description of a particular restaurant by analyzing users' reviews to help the restaurants in better advertising their stronger points. We plan to construct a Language Model by using data provided by Yelp, a third-party corpus or scrapping restaurant articles from Wikipedia and implement POS Tagging techniques and LSTM based approaches for text generation.
